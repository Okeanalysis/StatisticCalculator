Statistics Calculator
This project is a Statistics Calculator that performs a variety of common statistical operations. It is implemented in both Python (.py) and a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format for ease of use and experimentation. The calculator uses NumPy and SciPy libraries for fast and efficient computations.

Features
The calculator supports the following operations:

Mean: Calculate the arithmetic average of a dataset.

Mode: Find the most frequent value(s) in a dataset.

Median: Find the middle value in a dataset.

Variance: Measure the spread of data points.

Standard Deviation: Compute the dispersion of data from the mean.

Correlation Matrix: Compute the pairwise correlations between variables.

Covariance: Measure how two variables change together.

Percentile: Find the percentile rank of a dataset.

Quartile: Compute the first, second, and third quartiles.

Sum: Calculate the total sum of all elements in the dataset.

Minimum: Find the smallest value in a dataset.

Maximum: Find the largest value in a dataset.

Product: Compute the product of all elements in a dataset.

Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:

NumPy

SciPy
